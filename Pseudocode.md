Steps to make a pizza

## Ingredients
For the dough: 
2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110째F/45째C)
3 1/2 - 4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar

For the Sauce:
1 can (14-16 oz) crushed tomatoes
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
Salt and pepper to taste
For Toppings(optional):
Shredded mozzarella cheese
Your favorite toppings (pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc.)

## Instructions
### Step 1[Prepare the dough]:
In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until foamy.
In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
Stir the mixture until a dough begins to form.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, adding more flour if needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.
### Step 2[Make the sauce]:
In a small saucepan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.
Add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper.
Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly. Remove from heat and set aside.
### Step 3[Preheat the oven]:
Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go (usually around 475-500째F/245-260째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.
### Step 4[Shape the dough]:
Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down to release the air.
Divide the dough into two equal portions for two pizzas.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion of dough into a circle of desired thickness. If you prefer a thinner crust, roll it out thinner; for a thicker crust, leave it a bit thicker.
### Step 5[Assemble the pizza]:
Place the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel or lightly greased baking sheet.
Spoon sauce onto the dough, spreading it evenly, leaving a small border around the edges.
Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
Add your desired toppings.
### Step 6[Bake the pizza]:
If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the assembled pizza onto the preheated stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, simply place the baking sheet with the pizza into the oven.
Bake the pizza for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.
### Step 7[Serve]:
Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy your homemade pizza!
